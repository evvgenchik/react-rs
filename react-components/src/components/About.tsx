      <h1>Welcome to ITBookshop!</h1>
      <div>
        ITBookshop an online bookshop with a mission to increase developers
        level. We believe that bookshops are essential to a healthy culture.
        They are where authors can connect with readers, where we discover new
        writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of reading that can
        last a lifetime. They are also anchors for our high streets and
        communities -- owned, staffed, run and full of real people who have a
        genuine love of books and reading. As more and more people buy their
        books online, we wanted to create an easy, convenient way for you to get
        your books and support independent bookshops at the same time. If you
        want to choose a specific bookshop to support, choose them from our map
        and they’ll receive 30% of the cover price (or almost all of the profit)
        on your orders for a year. Otherwise, 10% of the cover price of your
        order will contribute to an earnings pool that will be evenly
        distributed among participating independent bookshops each month. Either
        way, your order is sent straight to your address, and all in-stock items
        arrive in 2-3 days. We also support anyone who advocates for books
        through our affiliate programme, which pays a 10% commission on every
        sale, and gives a matching 10% to independent bookshops. If you are an
        author, a website or magazine, a bookclub, an organisation that wants to
        recommend books, or even just a book-lover with an Instagram feed, you
        can sign up to be an affiliate, start your own shop, and be rewarded for
        your book recommendations. By design, we give away the vast majority of
        our profit to bookshops, publications, authors and the many others who
        make up the thriving, inspirational culture around books and reading.
        Ultimately, we hope readers visit and enjoy independent bookshops
        whenever they can and that Bookshop.org makes it easy for readers to
        support the indies we all love, even when they can’t. Independent
        bookshops deserve a larger share of the online book-buying market. We
        hope that Bookshop.org can help strengthen the fragile ecosystem around
        bookselling and keep local bookshops an integral part of our culture and
        communities. Bookshop is a B-Corp - a corporation dedicated to the
        public good.
